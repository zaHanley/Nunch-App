# nosh. App
nosh. allows you to create cookbooks(categories) using your own personal recipes that you've mastered, or by importing that one Pinterest recipe you didn't quite nail the first time. Have a recipe you use often, but think it tastes better with more than 2 cloves of garlic or a healthy splash of whiskey? Update any recipe you've added to your cookbook to suit your needs. Assign each recipe to their own custom cookbooks to make quick work of this week's dinner plans. Recipe didn't go over well at the cookout? Yeah - you're gonna want to go ahead and delete it. (What recipe? Oh, I think Karen brought that...)
